This repository contains the code used in the Percoloing Pelicans Group Report. Some of this code has been taken from the book "Percolation Theory Using Python" by Anders Malthe-Sørenssen, and co-pilot 
(GPT-4) was used to debug some of the code.
The definitions in the report and much of the information was also taken from 
"Percolation Theory Using Python" by Anders Malthe-Sørenssen.
